# Paper Outline

## Outline
- Summary
- Statement of need
    - As remote sensing archives become larger it is becoming infeasible to process this data locally
    - This has promoted the movement of workflows to the cloud
    - This is particularly true of SAR data, which is larger and more complex
    - Most SAR data require some pre-processing before they are analysis-ready
    - SAR processing is computationally-intensive and requires complicated/expensive software
    - ESA Sentinel-1 mission provides near real-time global SAR monitoring 
        - There is too much satellite imagery for anybody to use
        - On-demand products allow for users to select AOIs for pre-processing workflow
    - State of the field
        - SlideRule
            - Well-designed service for ICESAT missions
        - Descartes Labs
            - Provides cloud SAR processing for larger customers at cost
        - Google Earth Engine
            - Provides services for cloud image processing
            - SAR is not focus
            - Not open source
            - Lacks standardized workflows
        - Microsoft Planetary Computer
            - Open source cloud image processing
            - Limited SAR support
            - Lacks standardized workflows
- HyP3 description
    - HyP3 development history
        - Started as a student summer intern project at UAF in 2016
        - ASF DAAC was entirely on-prem in 2016, and pivot to AWS was on the horizon with rumblings of NISAR
        - Originally designed for either on-prem or AWS
            - Had hybrid of both on-prem and cloud components
            - Emphasis on subscriptions
        - ASF transition to AWS made evident the benefits of transitioning fully to the cloud
            - Distributed first image from S3 in 2016
        - In 2019 HyP3 was rewritten to be cloud native with emphasis on:
            - serverless architecture
            - scalability
            - containerized workflows
            - high-throughput computing
            - utilize new AWS Batch service
        - Release of they HyP3 Python SDK and integration with ASF Data Search (Vertex) website greatly improved usability
        - Public release on HyP3 in 2019, with free processing of RTC/InSAR workflows for anyone
        - Early success led to creation of additional HyP3 deployments for interested partners
            - JPL ACCESS19 project
            - JPL ITS_LIVE MEaSUREs project
            - Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO)

        - In 2022 HyP3 was migrated to NASA Earthdata Cloud with stable funding from NASA

                - (buzzwords: - API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, Step Functions, Batch, S3, Docker/Container, ECR, CloudWatch, CloudFormation)
            - Cloud-native (AWS) API-based processing workflow for satellite imagery 
            - High throughput, scalable and cost-effective computing, not high performance computing
            - Designed to work with any image processing pipeline via use of containerized batch jobs for processing
            - Infrastructure as code with AWS CloudFormation Templates

                - Delegate appropriate plugin container and memory requirements for job type
                - Watch for failures, log, and automatically retry
                - Upload completed jobs and updates DynamoDB table with job status (FAILED, SUCCEEDED)
