# Paper Outline

## Outline
- Summary
- Statement of need
    - Most SAR data require some pre-processing before they are analysis-ready
    - SAR processing is computationally-intensive and requires complicated/expensive software
    - ESA Sentinel-1 mission provides near real-time global SAR monitoring 
      - There is too much satellite imagery for anybody to use
      - OnDemand products allow for users to select AOIs for pre-processing workflow
    - Related work
- HyP3 description
    - HyP3 development history
        - Started as a student project at UAF
          - RTC processing workflow established and team wanted to make it more accessible/automated
          - Goal to integrate cloud-based computing (where 'Hybrid' in HyP3 originated)
        - Value was evident, so was turned into a full-fledged application
            - Added automated testing, CI/CD, IaC
    - HyP3 Architecture

          - (buzzwords: - API Gateway, Lambda, Dynamo DB, Step Functions, Batch, S3, Docker/Container, ECR, CloudWatch, CloudFormation)
        - Cloud-native (AWS) API-based processing workflow for satellite imagery 
        - High throughput, scalable and cost-effective computing, not high performance computing
        - Designed to work with any image processing pipeline via use of containerized batch jobs for processing
        - Infrastructure as code with AWS CloudFormation Templates
          - CF templates make new, specialized deployments easy
        - API Gateway receives GET, POST requests
        - Post Request logged in DynamoDB NoSQL database
        - AWS Lambda runs on a schedule and watches DynamoDB jobs table for new (PENDING) jobs
        - AWS Step Functions defines workflow for a particular job type
            - Delegate appropriate plugin container and memory requirements for job type
            - Watch for failures, log, and automatically retry
            - Upload completed jobs and updates DynamoDB table with job status (FAILED, SUCCEEDED)
        - AWS Batch runs appropriate plugin container for job type
            - UTILIZES SPOT INSTANCES FOR COST MANAGEMENT
            - Scales according to usage compared to monthly budget allowance (using AWS Cost Explorer)
        - AWS S3 buckets house results download 
          - Output data are publicly available for 2 weeks 
    - Plugin development via HyP3-cookiecutter
        - Template for creating HyP3 containerized plugins
          - Defines the entrypoint so that HyP3 can understand how to run the container
        - AWS ECR repositories straightforward to create for cookiecutter containers
    - HyP3 Access
        - Programmatic access
            - HyP3 API
              - Swagger UI with OpenAPI specification
              - Can submit and monitor jobs
            - HyP3-SDK
              - Programmatic Python interface to HyP3 API
              - Can submit, monitor, and download jobs
        - Web Access
            - Vertex Integration
              - GUI front-end that allows people to submit RTC jobs, and monitor and download all types of jobs
              - Provides tools for selecting pairs and stacks for InSAR analysis
- Projects utilizing HyP3
    - HyP3-GAMMA 
      - RTC and InSAR processing workflows on demand
      - Commercial software 
    - DockerizedTopsApp
      - open source InSAR processing for Sentinel-1 Geocoded Unwrapped Interferograms (GUNW)
    - HyP3-AutoRIFT
      - Specialized algorithm finding pixel displacement between two radar or optical images developed by the ITS_LIVE team at JPL `[@Lei:2021]`
    - Watermap
      - Processing utilizing RTC products with different polarizations to estimate flood extent and depth
